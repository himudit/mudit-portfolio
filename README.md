## About

**ronit.io** is my personal website where I share my projects, blog posts, and more. It's built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The site is designed to be fast, accessible, and easy to maintain.

The website will feature an **AI-powered chatbot** (coming soon) that can answer questions about my professional background and experience, making it easy for visitors to learn more about my work and projects interactively.

## AI Chatbot (Coming Soon) üöÄ

The website will feature an **AI-powered FAQ chatbot** that can answer questions about Ronit's professional background, projects, and experience.

> **Note**: The chatbot is currently disabled and shows "Coming Soon" on hover. It will be enabled once the site is deployed to a platform that supports server-side API routes (like Vercel or Netlify) instead of GitHub Pages.

### Planned Features:

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered**: Will use Google Gemini API for intelligent responses
- üõ°Ô∏è **Anti-Abuse Protection**: reCAPTCHA verification to prevent spam and misuse
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Will work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- üé® **Neobrutalism Theme**: Clean, minimal design matching the site aesthetic
- ‚ö° **Quick Actions**: Pre-built suggestions for common questions
- üîí **Session-Based**: Verify once per session for smooth user experience

### How it will work:

1. Click the "Ask Ronit AI" button (currently shows "Coming Soon")
2. Complete reCAPTCHA verification (first-time only)
3. Chat with the AI about Ronit's experience, projects, and professional background
4. Get instant, contextual responses with suggested follow-up questions

The chatbot will operate in two modes:

- **With Gemini API**: Full AI capabilities with natural language understanding
- **Without API**: Falls back to curated FAQ responses for basic questions

### Security & Privacy:

- reCAPTCHA verification prevents automated abuse and spam
- No conversation data will be stored or logged
- API calls will be rate-limited and monitored
- All interactions will be session-based (no persistent data)
